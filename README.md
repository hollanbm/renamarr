# Renamarr (previously sonarr-series-scanner)

With the addition of radarr support, I've decided to rename this project to Renamarr

## Quick Start

### docker

1) Copy/Rename [config.yml.example](docker/config.yml.example) to `config.yml`
2) Update `config.yml` as needed.
    * See [Configuration](#configuration) for further explanation
3) Bring up app using provided [docker-compose.yml](docker/docker-compose.yml)

### helm

coming soon


## How it works

### Renamarr

This job uses the [Sonarr API](https://sonarr.tv/docs/api/)/[Radarr API](https://radarr.video/docs/api/) to do the following

* Iterate over all items (Movies or Series)
  * Checks if any items need to be renamed
    * Radarr [get_api_v3_rename](https://radarr.video/docs/api/#/RenameMovie/get_api_v3_rename)
    * Sonarr [get_api_v3_rename](https://sonarr.tv/docs/api/#/RenameEpisode/get_api_v3_rename)
  * Triggers a rename on any item that need be renamed
    * Series renames are batched up, for one rename call per series
    * Movie renames are initiated per movie.
      * Example, 1 movie, 2 files. There will be 2 rename API calls

#### Analyze Files
This config option is useful if you have audio/video codec information as part of your mediaformat, and you are transcoding files after import. This will initiate a rescan of the files in your library, so that the mediainfo will be udpated. Then renamarr will come through and detect changes, and rename the files


### Series Scanner (Sonarr Only)
This job uses the [Sonarr API](https://sonarr.tv/docs/api/) to do the following

* Iterate over continuing [series](https://sonarr.tv/docs/api/#/Series/get_api_v3_series)
  * If a series has an episode airing within `config.sonarr[].series_scanner.hours_before_air`
    * default value of 4, max value of 12
  * OR
  * An episode that has aired previously
  * With a title of TBA (excluding specials)
    * will trigger a series refresh, to hopefully pull new info from The TVDB

This should prevent too many API calls to the TVDB, refreshing individual series, hourly

### Usage

The application run immediately on startup, and then continue to schedule jobs every hour (+- 5 minutes) after the first execution.
